纹理压缩的好处：

1. 提升性能：纹理越小，从内存读取它到显卡的时间锁消耗的时间越少。 Memory bandwidth is precious, particularly in mobile platforms where shared memory architectures are prevalent.  
2. 减少内存占用，In addition, any savings in memory requirements are very useful for mobile and tablet devices where, as mentioned, memory is shared across an entire System on Chip (SoC).  
3. 省电: 移动设备上内存访问是很耗电的，减小了纹理占用的内存，自然就减少了内存访问量，所以就减少了耗电量。


纹理经过一次压缩后，存在显存中(以PVRTC,ETC等格式)，每次需要进行纹理采样的时候都要执行一次（快速）实时解压缩，被解压的数据会存在一个小的纹理缓存中。
由于几乎不可能预测纹素被访问的顺序，任何纹理压缩算法必须允许对其中纹素的随机访问。
所以几乎所有的纹理压缩算法都以块为单位压缩和存储纹素，当某一纹素被访问时，只有同一块中若干纹素被读取和解压缩。


Unity:When you use a Texture compression format that is not supported on the target platform, the Textures are decompressed to RGBA 32 and stored in memory alongside the compressed Textures. When this happens, time is lost decompressing Textures, and memory is lost because you are storing them twice. 
Block Compression

BC stands for “block compression”, and the BCn formats all operate in terms of 4×4 blocks of pixels. All images are sliced up into these small blocks, and each block is self-contained—the data to decode it is all in one contiguous chunk in memory. Moreover, the size of each compressed block is fixed—either 8 or 16 bytes, depending on which BCn format is being used. This represents a 4:1 or 8:1 compression ratio, if the source image is in 8-bit RGBA format.
This standard layout is designed to make it easy for the GPU to use these formats for rendering. GPUs need to be able to quickly access any part of a texture; they don’t read the entire image sequentially, so streaming compression algorithms and those that have variable compression ratios are poorly suited for this application. The fixed block size makes it easy to locate the BCn block containing any given pixel, and the self-contained block data means that the GPU can decompress just the part of the image it needs to access.
Moreover, texture samples often exhibit locality in both dimensions—if one pixel from a texture is accessed, it’s likely that other pixels nearby in 2D will be accessed too. The 4×4 block structure supports this well, since it’s convenient to decompress all 16 pixels at once and then store them in the texture cache, where they can be efficiently reused for additional sampling operations.
The first three BCn formats are better known as DXT1, DXT3, and DXT5, respectively, but BCn (for n between 1 and 7) are the more up-to-date names for these formats.
